<p>Hudson understands the <a href="http://kenai.com/projects/csdutilities/pages/Debt">Debt</a>
analysis report XML format. When this option is configured and your
build runs the Maven goal <code>debt:debt</code> then Hudson provides
useful information about analysis results, such as historical result
trends, module and package statistics, web UI for viewing analysis
reports, and so on.</p>
<p>This plug-in is not invoked for failed builds, it is only called for
stable or unstable builds (i.e., a build with failed tests).</p>
